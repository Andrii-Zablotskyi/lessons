        Valery Lobanovsky Of the players who have ever played in the Odessa
        “Chernomorets”, the loudest name is Valery Lobanovsky. Odessa period
        an outstanding player and coach was short-lived, but left a noticeable mark in
        his biography.

        <p>Valery Vasilyevich Lobanovsky was born on January 6, 1939
          years in Kyiv. Early on he became interested in football, which became his profession, although
          Valery graduated from high school with a silver medal and (which is completely
          uncharacteristically for football players) entered the Kyiv Polytechnic
          institute. </p>

        <p>His career as a player in the Kyiv "Dynamo" quickly went to
          mountain. Champion of the USSR (1961), winner of the USSR Cup (1964), involved
          for games in the national team and the Olympic team of the USSR. Valery
          Lobanovsky became famous as the inventor of a unique corner kick
          “dry sheet”, after which his partners often scored goals against
          enemy. But after the conflict with the new coach V. Maslov in 1965
          V. Lobanovsky moved to the Odessa “Chernomorets”.

      For two seasons spent in Odessa, V. Lobanovsky played 59 matches and
      scored 15 goals. However, perhaps the main result of his stay in
      our city began to receive a diploma of higher education in Odessa
      Polytechnic Institute (OPI). Oddly enough, this detail is not
      found reflection in numerous biographies of the outstanding football player
      masters, therefore we will dwell on it in more detail.</p><br>
    <div class="main-content">
      <p> The invitation was initiated by V.
        Lobanovsky to Odessa was the then chairman of the Chernomorsky
        Basin Council DSO “Vodnik” P. Dosich. Football player with his wife and
        little daughter was given a two-room apartment on the street
        Bebel (Jewish), 42. And on April 6, 1965, by order of the rector of the OPI V.
        Lobanovsky was enrolled as a “5th year student of the correspondence department
        Faculty of Heat and Power Engineering Group PT-51z”. As they say
        university veterans, student V. Lobanovsky differed from many “correspondence students”
        serious attitude to study, as far as, of course, this was possible in
        conditions of constant training and moving. </p>

      <p>However, he managed
        prepare and successfully defend a graduation project on the topic “Gas supply
        auxiliary shops of the steel-rolling plant. Dzerzhinsky". Protection
        took place on June 21, 1966, the student was rated “good”.
        By the decision of the State Attestation Commission (minutes No. 29 dated
        06/21/1966) V. Lobanovsky was awarded the qualification
        "Industrial thermal power engineer".

      Meanwhile, things in “Chernomorets” were not going well. In many ways
      it was due to coaching miscalculations. V. Lobanovsky, becoming
      team captain, tried to prove that it was necessary to change both tactics and
      training system. Disagreements sometimes reached the point that the football player
      took a few balls and trained on his own. So it's possible with
      to a certain degree of approximation to say that it is in “Chernomorets” by V.
      Lobanovsky took the first steps towards his coaching
      future. </p><br>

      <p>However, this happened after the March 1967
        the footballer left the Odessa team. Valery Lobanovsky Further
        the biography of V. Lobanovsky is well known. He is considered to be one
        of the best coaches in the history of world football. Infinitely Devoted
        his work, V. Lobanovsky and died on May 13, 2002 in Zaporozhye, during
